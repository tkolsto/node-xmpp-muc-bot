I'm Bender, baby, please insert liquor!
Tempers are wearing thin. Let's hope some robot doesn't kill everybody.
Bite my shiny metal ass!
That's no alien spaceship-that's my ass!
Life can be hilariously cruel.
Ahhh, what an awful dream. Ones and zeroes everywhere... and I thought I saw a two.
I guess a robot would have to be crazy to wanna' be a folk-singer...
A grim day for robot-kind. But we can always build more killbots.
I'm gonna drink 'til I reboot.
I assure you, I barely know the meaning of the word labor.
Arrr! The laws of science be a harsh mistress.
This is the best nanosecond of my life! No this one is! No this one!
Hey hey! Ho ho! One zero zero one one zero!
Alright, alright. If it'll make you happy I'll overthrow society.
No fair! You changed the results by measuring it!
What's wrong? Did you swallow another cell phone?
It's not uncharted, you lost the chart!
I guess I could part with one doomsday device and still be feared.
Now that's a wave of destruction that's easy on the eyes.
Oh my god. I'm so excited I wish I could wet my pants!
Bite my shiny metal ass!
Well, we're boned!
I love you, meatbags!
Whip harder, Professor!
Into the breach, meatbags. Or not, whatever.
I am Bender, please insert girder.
NOOOOOOOO!
No crap. My grandmother was a bulldozer.
That makes me feel sexy, and I'm asexual.
You humans are so cute when you're scared.
